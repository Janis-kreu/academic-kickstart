I am an applied labor economist working on topics related to international migration and family location decisions. I am a IZA and CreAM Research Fellow and have been awarded the Labour Economics Prize for the best article in Labour Economics in 2016. 

I lead the Economic Assimilation Research Network, which was awarded the Innovation Fund Denmark's Grand Solutions research grant in 2017.
