I am a PhD Candidate in the Economics department at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/). My research focuses on applied microeconomics. My primary research interests are migration, and labor and public economics. I am currently on the job market and will be available for interviews at APPAM and the 2020 ASSA meetings.

In my dissertation, I examine how the inflow of Indochinese refugees affected U.S. children's academic achievement, high school completion, post secondary education, and early labor market outcomes.

In a separate project, I look at how the timing of language acquisition affects adult refugees' dynamic labor market outcomes.
