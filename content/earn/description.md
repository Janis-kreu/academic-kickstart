Since 1999, the municipalities have been responsible for integrating refugees, immigrants and family reunified people into the Danish labor market. 
Over the years, the municipalities have taken a different approach to the task of raising integration efforts within the external framework and conditions created by changing governments and structural conditions.
Many methods and models have been developed and tested locally, but there is still uncertainty about what works, how and under what conditions. 
This will be investigated by the research network EARN (Economic Assimilation Research Network).
