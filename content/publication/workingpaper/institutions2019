abstract: We study the role of labor market institutions and policies in affecting the wage impact of immigration using a cross-country meta-analysis approach. We gather information on 1,548 previouslyreported semi-elasticities from 66 academic studies covering 20 developed countries. We supplement this dataset with country-level institutional structure and coverage data from the OECD. Theseinclude employment and wage rigidities, labor mobility, active labor market programs spending, andproduct market regulation. We relate estimated wage effects and institutional coverage while controlling for local economic conditions, immigrant skill composition, time and region fixed effectsand study characteristics. Higher labor market rigidity, as brought about by more widespread insti-tutions, regulations and policies, mitigates the effects on relative wages of high- versus low-skillednatives but exacerbates the impacts on average earnings. Overall, our results suggest that labor market institutions and policies may be effective tools in the economic absorption of foreign workers.
