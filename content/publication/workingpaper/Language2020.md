abstract: We evaluate a Danish reform focused on improving Danish language training for those granted refugee  status  on  or  after  January  1,  1999.   Using  a  Regression  Discontinuity  Design  we  find  a significant,  permanent,  positive effect on earnings. This effect emerged after completion of language classes and was accompanied by additional schooling and higher probability of working in communication-intensive jobs, suggesting that language training, rather than other minor aspects of the reform, produced it. We also find evidence of higher completion rates of lower secondary school and lower probability of crime for male children with both parents exposed to the reform.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

Effect emerged after completion of language classes and was accompanied by additional schooling and higher probability of working in communication-intensive jobs, suggesting that language training, rather than other minor aspects of the reform, produced it. Spillover effect on higher school completion and lower probability of crime for male children with both parents exposed to the reform."
