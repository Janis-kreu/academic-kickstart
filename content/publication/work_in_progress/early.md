abstract: This study investigates how early on-the-job training affects refugeesâ€™ host country language learning and provides new evidence on longer-run employment effects. To identify the causal effect of early on-the-job training on language course outcomes, education, and employment, we utilize a gradual rollout of that training combined with a dispersal policy of refugees across municipalities in Denmark. We find that additional time spent in the labor market cannot substitute for time spent in language training: Participating in on-the-job training in the year of arrival decreases test scores on compulsory language tests. This effect is significantly stronger for higher-skilled refugees who also experience a significant reduction in hours of instruction attendance. While early on-the-job training has a temporary positive impact on employment for both skill groups, it decreases educational enrollment for high-skilled refugees and increases it for the low-skilled. Whereas early entry to the labor market has no positive long-run effects for higher-skilled refugees, it benefits those with the lowest skills.
