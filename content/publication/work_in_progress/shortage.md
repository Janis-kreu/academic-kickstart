abstract: We evaluate an integration concept that, based on an analysis of local labor market shortages and a sequence of ALMP tailored to equip
the refugee with the skills required to take a job within a specific industry with local excess demand, direct newly arrived refugees towards
these job. The concept gradually spread over Danish municipalities during the past decade and we exploit the gradual roll-out in a staggered difference-in-difference estimator to uncover the causal effect of this approach. We find that this demand-side approach to integrating refugees into the local labor market accelerated refugeesâ€™ job finding such that the earnings in the first year increase by 50%, compared to the mean.
