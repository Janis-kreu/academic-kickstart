On April 21 2020 I presented my latest work *Integrating Refugees: Language Training or Work-First Incentives? (joint with Jacob Nielsen Arendt, Iben Bolvig, Linea Hasager and Giovanni Peri)*. The recording of the online semiar is available [here](https://www.cream-migration.org/eventdetail.php?id=291).
